# 5-Flower-CNN
Welcome to my 5-Flower-CNN project! ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ»ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ»

## Overview
This repository documents my journey, building a CNN for classifying five different types of flowers: Daisy, Dandelion, Tulip, Rose, and Sunflower. The model itself and learning exercise is based on a VGG-16 challenge presented by Kaggle.

## Files
**Flower CNN.ipynb**

This file within the notebooks folder, not only documents the process by which I developed my final model but also reports briefly about the interim models.

**Flower UI.ipynb**

This file within the notebooks folder, is the front-end coding to produce a Gradio based UI. 

## Hugging Face Model
Check out my pre-trained model on Hugging Face Spaces, an interactive tool that can perform flower classification with just a few clicks!

## Learning Journey 
This project has been a solid learning experience, providing insights into CNN architecture and optimization strategies. I appreciate you stopping to explore the notebooks, contribute, and share your thoughts and feedback!
