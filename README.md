# 5-Flower-CNN
Within the notebooks folder is a file, Flower CNN.ipynb, that documents the journey I have made to synthesize a CNN based on VGG-16 and the CNN classification problem presented by Kaggle. 

This side project has helped me learn a lot about CNN architecture and optimisation. From which the second file, Flower UI.ipnyb, that uses Gradio to make a UI for flower classification. 

Please have a look and feel free to let me know your thoughts!
